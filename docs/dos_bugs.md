# DOS bugs the port does not reproduce

STATUS: living record, not an audit dump. Authoritative.

VICEROY.EXE behaviour that is a bug in the original and that this port
**deliberately does not reproduce**. Fidelity to DOS is the default
([project_goals.md](project_goals.md)); an entry here is an explicit, user-approved
exception to it. Add a row only when the user has agreed the DOS behaviour is
undesirable — an agent must not decide this alone (every "stand-in" so far turned
out wrong; see [conventions.md](conventions.md)).

Not this file:

- Port diverges from DOS but DOS is *right* (data-model cost, capture still
  needed): [known_divergences.md](known_divergences.md).
- DOS bug that **is** ported literally (e.g. `colony_workers.c` ~989, the
  `ai_contact_demand.c` ~2517 census total, the `ai_diplo.c` ~2087 OVL16 transfer):
  no entry anywhere; the `DOS-LITERAL` comment at the port site records it.
- Actionable port bug: [port_bugs.md](port_bugs.md).

Entries keep their `port_bugs.md #` id when they came from a bug row, so
citations still resolve; ids are permanent and never reused. Each entry names the
DOS function (`FUN_ssss_oooo` + raw offset), what DOS does, what the port does
instead, and the port site, so a later reader can tell "intentional" from
"drifted". Grep this file for a feature before "fixing" a port/DOS mismatch.
