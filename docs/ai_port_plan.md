# AI Port — Sequential Work Plan

A living, ordered queue for finishing the Euro/Indian/King AI port. This file
owns **sequencing** — which item to pick up next and why it's placed there.
It does not own status detail: that stays in
[ai_transcription.md](ai_transcription.md) (FUN_* inventory, per-cluster
fidelity claims) and the `original_sources_annotated/ai/*.md` thin maps.
Phase priority for the whole project stays in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

**Ordering principle:** tiers are ordered from *fully agent-autonomous* to
*requires the user's live DOSBox-X session*. Work the earliest unfinished
item in the earliest tier that has one. Only drop to a later tier when every
item ahead of it is done or genuinely blocked (blocker stated in its row).
The intent: exhaust what's solvable from decomp/ASM/overlay tooling alone
before asking the user to sit at DOSBox-X again — prior passes have
repeatedly found that a thing filed as "needs a live dump" turned out to be
reachable once better static tooling (`tools/rtlink_overlay_extract.py`,
`address_mapping.csv`, `rtlink_decode`'s jump-table parser) was applied
properly. Re-check that before trusting an old "blocked" verdict at face
value — but don't rabbit-hole re-litigating closed items either.

## How an agent should use this file

1. Read this file **and** [ai_transcription.md](ai_transcription.md) first
   (CLAUDE.md rule 1 — don't let context compaction wipe either).
2. Pick the first unchecked item in the first tier that has one. If it's
   marked blocked-on-something already done, re-verify the blocker before
   starting (tooling may have moved on since it was written).
3. Do the work using the method notes below. Run the **full** `ctest` suite
   before calling anything done, not just the touched target.
4. Update: this file's checkbox + a one-line result note, the owning status
   table in `ai_transcription.md` or the relevant
   `original_sources_annotated/ai/*.md`, and — if it's a substantial
   session — the `ai-transcription-fulldraft` memory file.
5. If new work surfaces mid-task (a new blocker, a new candidate function),
   add a row to the right tier here rather than chasing it immediately,
   unless it's a one-line fix directly enabling the item in progress.
6. **Never** `git commit`/`push`/switch branches — the user handles version
   control. Work stays uncommitted in the tree.
7. Tier 3 items are flip-a-switch decisions with user-visible behavior or
   policy impact (re-enabling a golden gate, wiring a reference-only port
   live as the default path) — do the verification work, but confirm with
   the user before actually flipping the switch, per CLAUDE.md's "hard to
   reverse / outward-facing" rule. Everything in Tiers 1–2 is safe to just
   do.

## Method notes (don't relearn these)

Condensed from `ai-transcription-fulldraft` memory (full detail there if a
lesson below needs more context):

- Read the **raw decompiled function** directly before trusting a secondary
  annotated-doc summary — those have drifted from the actual bytes before.
- A `CALLF <loader>; JMPF 0x0000:XXXX` in a decompile is an **unpatched
  RTLink placeholder**, not real content — resolve it via `rtlink_decode`'s
  jump-table parser (info mode), never by naive tail-following or reading
  the raw bytes as data. This mistake produced at least two false "looks
  like the turn loop" / "looks like a data table" leads before the fix.
- A `completed=true` decompile can still carry real corruption, either in
  its own body (`WARNING: Instruction ... overlaps` / `bad instruction
  data` / decompile timeout) or **inlined from a callee** — check the text
  for `WARNING:` and check whether a cited address actually falls inside
  the target function's own boundary before concluding "corrupted." Ghidra
  can also silently pull in *wrong but plausible* content via jump/call
  misresolution with no warning at all (`684c_08c0`, `15eb_1d4c` — both
  false alarms on first pass, confirmed clean on the second, boundary-first
  check). Prefer `tools/rtlink_overlay_extract.py` +
  `tools/GhidraImportOverlays.java` (re-disassembles each RTLink segment at
  its true DOS address) over the flattened `viceroy_unpacked.c` export for
  anything flagged suspicious.
- Cross-check any unnamed DS global / resident helper against
  `original_sources_annotated/include/viceroy_globals.h` and
  `tools/address_mapping.csv` before assuming it needs a live dump — many
  "unlabeled" globals turn out to already be named for a sibling function.
- **Never invent a constant.** If a price/byte table has no captured value
  anywhere in the project, leave it stubbed with a comment, don't guess —
  this is why `417e`'s two byte tables and `0x2f76`'s terrain-cost table
  are still open (Tier 4) rather than wired with made-up numbers.
- Structural confidence (params line up, globals are named, formula shape
  fits) is **not** semantic confidence (what real-world mechanic this is).
  Keep the two separate in write-ups; the `417e` teach-price/incite
  identification saga is the cautionary example.
- When a fidelity fix changes behavior, the existing unit test usually
  encodes the *old* behavior — expect to rewrite test scenarios. For large
  cumulative single-`main()` test files, use a Python line-range splice
  instead of Edit's exact-string match.
- The harness `TaskList` does **not** persist across sessions — this file
  plus `ai_transcription.md`'s status tables plus `git log` are the
  continuity mechanism, not `TaskCreate`/`TaskList`.

## Tier 1 — Static RE + port (fully agent-autonomous)

Pure decomp/ASM reading, semantic RE, C port, `ctest` verification. No user
needed beyond periodic status updates.

- [ ] **T1.1 — Deep `20e6` remaining field fidelity.** Full arms +
  combat-resolve field fidelity is still OPEN per R5 Phase 1
  (`ai_transcription.md`). Entry points:
  [`move_scoring_20e6_full.md`](../original_sources_annotated/ai/move_scoring_20e6_full.md),
  [`move_scoring_land.md`](../original_sources_annotated/ai/move_scoring_land.md),
  [`move_scoring_ship.md`](../original_sources_annotated/ai/move_scoring_ship.md).
  Linux side: `ai_euro_score_step` / `ai_euro_land_*` / `ai_euro_naval_*` in
  `ai_euro.c`.

- [ ] **T1.2 — Full `LAB_521d_3558` cargo/colony sail matrix.** Still OPEN
  (R5 Phase 2/3 note it repeatedly). Current Linux only has thin tip/peel
  ports (`ai_euro_ocean_3558_first_leg_tip`,
  `ai_euro_ocean_3558_empty_cruise_tip`). Full multi-good cargo/colony
  scoring matrix unported.

- [ ] **T1.3 — Full multi-ring `06ae` first-colony landfall.** Current
  `ai_euro_06ae_first_colony_from_landfall` is a live west-box + coastal
  bias approximation; "adj `06ae` still misses some coastal first towns"
  (R0 dated entry). Needs the real DOS multi-ring search.

- [ ] **T1.4 — `2820` deep Haggle (`2f96`) / hard-bargain counter-offer
  (`306c`) sub-loops + multi-good cargo-select CHOICE (`0x15a0`).**
  Deliberately scope-parked (not corruption-blocked) per
  [`indian_trade_2820.md`](../original_sources_annotated/ai/indian_trade_2820.md)
  "Open RE" — worth re-attempting now that `2820`'s own body is a
  confirmed-clean 595-line re-disasm. Two data-offset blockers noted there
  (`*(int*)0x8d4e+2`, per-(nation,cargo) throttle at `-0x7b44`) may need
  Tier 4 if they're genuinely never-captured — check
  `address_mapping.csv`/`viceroy_globals.h` first, they only cover function
  entry points today so this may still need a capture; confirm before
  moving it to Tier 4.

- [ ] **T1.5 — `4528` deep raid body, ASM-faithful map `84216→end`.**
  Per [`indian_settlement_4528.md`](../original_sources_annotated/ai/indian_settlement_4528.md)
  "Open RE": full ASM-faithful mapping past the authentic head, wire
  `4528`'s 0/1/2 return codes into the move-foreign caller
  (`FUN_465b_0000`, already traced — see caller confirmation in the
  fulldraft memory), and the `GAME.TXT` string-table XREF `0x1710`–`0x172e`.
  Re-disassemble via the overlay tool first — corruption diagnosis for this
  function has flip-flopped before (see method notes above); verify the
  boundary before trusting old line estimates.

- [ ] **T1.6 — `FUN_6662_0f74` pathfinding subsystem.** Confirmed clean but
  large: `0015bc`/`0015c1` are two separate BFS flood-fill searches (16×16
  and 18×18 windows), `0015b7` is a small direct-step helper (the one
  genuinely quick win here, do it first within this item), a fifth helper
  `0009ae` untraced, and `000000` hits the known pcode-error decompiler bug
  (hand-transcribe like `FUN_5fef_0000`/`OVL12_L0000` were). Target: bring
  `units_next_goto_step`/`units_greedy_next_step` (`units.c`) — which
  already implements the same three-tier *shape* — closer to byte-exact.
  The toughness-deduction term and any wiggle-retry logic stay blocked on
  `0x2f76` (Tier 4) regardless — port everything else around that hole.
  See [`euro_unit_act.md`](../original_sources_annotated/ai/euro_unit_act.md)
  "2026-08-15" / "2026-08-19" updates.

- [ ] **T1.7 — Re-attempt `FUN_291f_0a14` boundary (Indian mid-game quiet
  scoring: goods/missions/capital pull).** R2 flags this as genuinely
  blocked on "a `2244`-style overlay re-recovery... canonical boundary
  looks wrong" — worth a fresh pass with the now-mature overlay tooling
  before accepting the old verdict. No golden currently exercises
  `colony_count>0` for a Brave, so there's nothing to regression-check
  against yet; document the port even if untestable, and note that gap.

- [ ] **T1.8 — `test_ai_king.c` fixture rewrite.** Mechanical, not
  RE-blocked: the file predates the real `38fd_5be8`/`38fd_3dc8` tax
  formula and still assumes deterministic year-gated, RNG-free audiences.
  Needs seeded RNG streams per scenario and `turn_number ≥ 30` setup
  instead of year-based. See R6 "Known test-suite gap" note in
  `ai_transcription.md`. Currently the whole 6000+-line single-`main()`
  file bails on assertion #1 — this blocks real coverage of everything
  else in that file, so it's higher-value than its size suggests.

- [ ] **T1.9 — KINGGALLEON2 (non-Cortes royal-galleon share) re-attempt.**
  Unpark #3, still PARKED "if evidence appears." Prior passes found the
  narrative-vs-condition reading contradictory and `FUN_48d3_06ba` a false
  lead (same-segment neighbor, not the target). Re-run with overlay-clean
  decompiles of that neighborhood — the corruption-diagnosis tooling that
  cracked `4528`/`417e`/etc. postdates the last attempt here per
  [`euro_unit_act.md`](../original_sources_annotated/ai/euro_unit_act.md)
  (search `KINGGALLEON2`).

---

## Tier 2 — Larger mechanical lifts (still agent-autonomous)

Bigger in scope than Tier 1 items but not blocked on anything static tooling
can't reach. Pick up after Tier 1 thins out, or interleave if a Tier 1 item
is genuinely stuck mid-session.

- [ ] **T2.1 — Verify `ai_euro_5d04_nation_planning_structural` against
  live behavior.** The full structural port of `5d04` exists
  (`ai_euro.c`) but is reference-only; the live `ai_euro_nation_planning`
  only took the treasury-bump formula from it. Before this can become a
  Tier 3 "wire it live" decision, do the legwork: run it side-by-side
  against `ai_euro_nation_planning` on existing goldens/fixtures, catalog
  every behavioral delta the swap would cause, and resolve the two
  remaining ambiguous list-iterator callees if feasible (see
  `ai-5d04-structural-port` memory for the resolved-symbol table and what's
  still open).

- [ ] **T2.2 — Verify `ai_diplo_153e_worthiness_score_structural`
  against live behavior.** Same shape as T2.1: structural reference port
  exists (`ai_diplo.c`), not wired live. Catalog deltas vs. current
  behavior before it's ready for a Tier 3 decision.

---

## Tier 3 — Confirm with the user before flipping

The engineering/verification for these can happen autonomously (do that
part under Tier 2 above); the actual switch-flip is a deliberate,
user-visible behavior or policy change — confirm before doing it, per
CLAUDE.md's "hard to reverse" guidance.

- [ ] **T3.1 — Wire `5d04` structural port live** (replace/extend
  `ai_euro_nation_planning`), once T2.1's delta catalog exists. This
  changes default AI economic/hire behavior.

- [ ] **T3.2 — Wire `153e` worthiness-score port live**, once T2.2's delta
  catalog exists. Changes default war-declare eligibility scoring.

- [ ] **T3.3 — Re-enable `golden_ai_turns`/`golden_ai_joint`.** Explicitly
  parked 2026-08-19 (`ai_transcription.md` top status note, `roadmap.md`
  phase 3) until the AI planner reaches T3 1:1 for in-scope planners —
  re-enabling early just chases "porting incomplete" symptoms. Don't flip
  this back on piecemeal; do it once Tier 1/2 above has meaningfully closed
  the gap, and confirm with the user first since it changes what `ctest`
  gates on by default.

---

## Tier 4 — Needs the user's live DOSBox-X session

Confirmed genuinely blocked without a live capture (register/stack trace,
memory dump, or hang-dump). Re-verify the blocker is still real (tooling
moves fast in this project) before asking the user to spend DOSBox-X time —
but don't resume speculatively either.

- [ ] **T4.1 — `DS:0x2f76..0x2f88`ish terrain-cost/toughness table.**
  Highest-leverage single capture identified so far: unblocks case-8
  Pioneer-improvement reward scale, `0f74`'s toughness-deduction term, and
  detour-route scoring (if T1.6's flood-fill tiers get ported) all at once.
  See `euro_unit_act.md` "highest-leverage single capture" note.

- [ ] **T4.2 — `FUN_41f2_0294` (village founding-worth cap) semantics.**
  Confirmed decompiler-corrupted (no recovered stack frame, `(void)`
  signature despite real call-site arguments) — needs a live
  register/stack trace, not just re-disassembly. Currently stubbed as
  `ai_indian_152e_worth_cap_stub`. Known *not* to be the cause of the
  TURN2→3 golden failure below (isolated separately) but is still a
  guaranteed future diff once goldens are back on.

- [ ] **T4.3 — TURN2→3 Brave quiet-pulse movement/RNG divergence.** Root
  cause not found (missing Brave `type=19 nation=6 xy=(39,20)` + 1-point
  `relation_by_indian` drift, reproduces identically regardless of the
  `152e` capital-gate fix). Deep, open-ended — try a fresh static pass with
  current overlay tooling first (nothing in the last investigation
  confirms a live dump is strictly required, just that static analysis
  hadn't found it yet); fall back to a hang-dump only if that's exhausted.

- [ ] **T4.4 — `2820` remaining unresolved DS fields.** `*(int*)0x8d4e+2`
  (new-offer price table distinct from the sticky-reoffer table),
  per-(Euro-nation, cargo) throttle at `-0x7b44`, string/format IDs
  `0x15a9`/`0x2e0c`/`0x2e0e`. Only pursue after confirming T1.4 can't reach
  them statically.

- [ ] **T4.5 — Incite (`417e`) Mode-2 trigger/caller.** Low value: Mode-1
  (human path) is fully ported and byte-faithful; whether an AI-vs-AI or
  AI-internal Mode-2 auto-incite is even a real mechanic is unconfirmed
  (the one capture that looked like it turned out to be a mis-decoded
  stack offset — see fulldraft memory passes 17–18). Optional; skip unless
  specifically requested.

- [ ] **T4.6 — `VR_B465X` hang dump.** Explicitly parked **by policy**
  (R0). Do not resume without a new, stated reason — this was a deliberate
  stop, not a stall.

---

## Tier 5 — Polish / chrome (last)

Deliberately last per `roadmap.md` phase 5 and `project_goals.md`'s
visual-polish-last rule. Some of these need the user's judgement call on
visual fidelity, not just RE.

- [ ] **T5.1 — VGA-identical dialog chrome** (meet/diplo/king wood frames,
  FA `3f41` full widget body, chief portrait `FUN_281f_04ac`).
- [ ] **T5.2 — Letter cinematic** (`43f7` `160a`).
- [ ] **T5.3 — Congress UI / F3 portrait grid.**
- [ ] **Not planned:** `COLDIG.BIN` digital SFX — investigated at length,
  no reachable DOS trigger found; treat as settled, not a queue item
  (`roadmap.md` phase 5).

---

## Updating this file

- Check an item off in place with a one-line result + date, don't delete
  the row — the history of what was tried is as useful as the current
  state (matches how `ai_transcription.md`'s changelog-style entries work).
- New discoveries go in the tier that matches their actual blocker, not
  wherever's convenient — a static-solvable item belongs in Tier 1 even if
  found while working a Tier 4 item.
- If a Tier 4/5 item turns out to be reachable statically after all (this
  has happened repeatedly — see method notes), promote it to Tier 1 with a
  note on what unblocked it, don't just solve it quietly in place.
- Keep tier 3's user-confirmation gate real — don't let "the verification
  looks fine" become an implicit yes.
