# Input-replay regressions

One subdirectory per test: `input.sav`, `input.jsonl`, `output.sav`.
Run by `regression_replay` (ctest); format and recording recipe in
[tests/README.md](../tests/README.md#input-replay-regressions).

Tests. All start from `port_saves/carpentry.SAV`. The `europe_*` ones use a copy
edited with `sav_json` to 60000 gold and a recruit pool of Fishermen /
Lumberjacks / Veteran Soldiers, and open the European Status screen with E:

| Test | Does |
|------|------|
| `europe_buy_artillery_twice` | PURCHASE Artillery twice (500, then 600) |
| `europe_buy_each_ship` | PURCHASE each ship type once |
| `europe_buy_each_good` | Buy two Galleons and a Merchantman, drag 100 of every good aboard (price popups dismissed) |
| `europe_recruit_each_immigrant` | RECRUIT pool rows 1, 2, 3 in turn |
| `europe_train_each_profession` | TRAIN every Royal University row once |
| `europe_buy_ship_and_sail` | PURCHASE a Caravel and sail it for the New World |
| `europe_reload_dock_artillery` | Loads `europe_buy_artillery_twice`'s output, opens and closes Europe, saves: the reload must be byte-identical |
| `europe_reload_dock_trained` | Same for `europe_train_each_profession`'s output (17 trained dock units, Pioneer tools) |
